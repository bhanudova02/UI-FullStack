                    Body Layout Design
               ----------------------------
-HTML uses "tables" for designing a layout, it is a common process upto version 4.
-Table content is not SEO friendly and can't load content in a sequential order.
-Hence HTML-5 introduced some new semantic & non-sematic elements for designing 
 body layout.
-These new elements will make page content SEO friendly and user friendly.

Non-Sematic Elements
--------------------
1.<div>        :it is a division for content is page. it keeps all realtive content together
2.<span>       :it is a division for inline content which spans along with existing.


CSS Borders:
------------
     {
          border:size style color;
     }

     size      :in pixels
     style     :double, dotted solid, dashed, groove etc.
     color     :color name, shade, hexa etc..


CSS Margin & Padding
--------------------
     {
          margin: all directions;
          margin-left:pixels;
          margin-right:pixels;         => similar for padding
          margin-top:pixels;
          margin-bottom:'pixels
     }



Example:
-------
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en-in">
    <head>
        <title>Online Shopping</title>
       <link rel="shortcut icon" href="./public/images/favicon.ico">
       <meta name="viewport" content="device=device-width, initial-scale=1.5">
       <style>
            div{
                border: 1px solid black;
                margin: 20px;
                padding: 10px;
            }
            span{
                color:red;
            }
       </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            Web Technologies
            <div>
                Front End
                <div>
                    HTML<br>
                    It is a <span>markup</span> language
                </div>
                <div>
                    CSS <br>
                    It is used for styling.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                Back End
                <div>
                    MongoDB <br>
                    It is a database
                </div>
                <div>
                    ExpressJs<br>
                    It is middleware
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>      
    </body>
</html>

Setup icons for Project:
-----------------------
1.Open Terminal in VS Code
2.Run the following command
     >npm install bootstrap-icons --save

3.It will create a new folder by name "node_modules" and adds

    "node_modules/bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css"


4.Link the CSS file to your HTML page
     
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./node_modules/bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
</head>


5.Every icons is having a class name, which you have to apply to any 
  container that can display text

               <div class="bi bi-twitter"></div>
               <span class="bi bi-house"></span>

Example:

CSS Border Radius: 

          border-Radius                  : all directions
          border-top-left-radius            
          border-top-right-radius
          border-bottom-left-radius
          border-bottom-rigt-radius

Note: To set a circle width,height, and radius must be equal.

     {
          width:100px;
          height:100px;
          border-radius:100px;
     }


You can't set width and height for <span>, as it is inline element.
You have to change span into a block level element.

{
     dispaly:block; (or) disaply:inline-block;
}
